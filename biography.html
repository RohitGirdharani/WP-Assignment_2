   <h2>Why Am I Different</h2>
   <p>I like to face challenges. Not only to face but to tackle them with smartness. If I accept any challenge then I complete it at any cost. I like to listen carefully before preceeding to any task.</p>

   <h2>What Can I Contribute</h2>
   <p class="intro">I think before contributing , one really has to identify the problem and problem can never be figured out when you start looking for them, instead it happens when you least expect it. As a computer science student, I would be more than happy to solve a problem within my own domain, since we are living in an era of technology. You never know any incident you might come across then think about it if there is a possiblity of solving it within your own field. </p>
